# Use of Variables and Tips to Use them

# 1. To perform calculations
# 2. To import the data and name that data
# 3. To store the results of the calculations
# 4. To store the results of the data

# Rules of Using Variables

# 1. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.
# 2. Spaces are not allowed in variable names, so we use underscores instead of spaces. For example, use student_name instead of "student name".
# 3. You cannot use Python keywords as variable names.
# 4. Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, mc_wheels is better than just "wheels", and number_of_wheels is better than just "n".
# 5. Be careful about using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O in places where they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
#    Python keywords are reserved words in python programming.
